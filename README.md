# week2-assignment

PROBLEM 1:
Create a repository on GitHub and call it “week2-assignment”, clone the repo to your local machine.

Create an HTML and JavaScript file, add boilerplate to the HTML file and link the JavaScript file to it, add and commit the changes after creating the file.

Inside the JavaScript file you have created do the following, add and commit the changes after each is done:

Create a simple age calculator program which accepts two inputs that is birth year and current year and return the age of the user which you are to solve following the problem-solving technique, write out the pseudocode on how to solve this problem.
Declare your variables to be used to solve this problem.
Implement the logic to solve the problem which is the implementation of your pseudocode.

SOLUTION 1:

How this program works;
1. The program will prompt the user to input;
  a. the current year 
  b. User's birth year
2. It will run the subtraction operation
3. The output will be the result of the subtraction of User's birth year from current year.


PROBLEM 2:
Lastly create an array of numbers, loop through the array and output only even numbers.,

SOLUTION 2
1.  We will define an array called numbersArray, just like making a list of numbers which contains numbers from 1 to 20.
2. We then create a function called isEven() that takes a number as input and returns true. if it's even and false otherwise. 
3. Inside the loop, we check each number in the array or our list using the isEven() function and use console.log() to output only the even numbers.
